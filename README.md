This Shiny app was made as part of SNA project. It visualizes football transfers from top 5 European leagues in 2 distinct periods.

Data is scraped from this [web location](https://www.footballdatabase.eu/en/) and the whole process of scraping and prepreocessing can be found 
in different [github repository](https://github.com/darko295/football_transfers_sna).
